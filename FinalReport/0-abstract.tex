For a long time, the need to collaborate, i.e. share information and services, has been widely recognized.
Yet still the isolation between different organizations or federations exists and become the roadblock.
To break the roadblock, we propose a Virtual Organization System (VO) providing the name category service for multiple organizations and users.
The system enable the rich and fine-grained access control by using attribute-based encryption (ABE).
The system is designed to be deployed on Named Data Networking (NDN).
NDN's content-centric authentication also enhance the security of the system and the semantic name of network-layer packet provides flexible and simple way to organize the virtual organization.
Also, our system support efficient content multicast and express distribution of keys.
We implemented a prototype of the system and made some evaluation of the system.
The results suggests that the system could perfectly serve the virtualization of real data producer in a secure and efficient way and provide ease of use for manager to build up VOs.
